# pragma_progs

This is the entire QC source code for pragma engine, which is a heavily modified Quake2 engine that runs its logic in QC. Engine itself is heavily work in progress and it is not yet usable for anything other than experiments.

The goal of this is not to rewrite Q2's C logic into QC but to provide a small and clean base implementation intended for future (maybe standalone?) projects, who knows

It's very WIP, incomplete and many things are completly changing from time to time, nothing is set in stone YET.

But it compiles and runs so far :)

# Why?
Because list of becauses is very very long, kek. I wanted to improve Q1 engine and I gave up with it after realizing that Q2 did exactly what I were doing to Q1 code (and much more), but it lacked scripts so here they are now.
Maybe one day someone modifies pragma to load Q1 assets and runs OG Quake1 on it
