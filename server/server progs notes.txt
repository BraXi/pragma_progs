builtins in = inc/pragma_builtins.qc
server structs = inc/pragma_globals_server.qc
globals shared by both cl/sv = inc/shared.qc

where entity defs are keeps = ./ent/
where monsters are keept = ./ai/

entry point = main.qc:main()
entry point is called AFTER entities from entitystring are spawned and you can precache/spawn things here too

called every server frame = main.qc:frame()

spawn functions should be defined as: float() SP_<classname> = {...};
and it should return TRUE or FALSE, if false edict will be freed
